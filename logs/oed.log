@2025-01-04#codestudy OED notes

@13:32 I'm on a train and poorly prepared #dz:codestudy/oed/news
No internet, and the project I was hoping to look
at (ripgre) is not on my computer at the moment. But ed is
here. Ed is here.

@13:47 weird while loop structure #dz:codestudy/oed/files/main.c/main/04_getopt_parsing
In C, you don't need braces for a while loop if there is
one statement. In this loop, they cram a switch statement
inside of a while loop. Since the switch statement is only
one statement.
---
Perhaps this is done to minimize indentation?

@13:50 was oed written in ed? #dz:codestudy/oed/questions
I wonder how that would influence the code style and code
structure.

@14:06 top-level main traversed #dz:codestudy/oed/news
I've done an initial spelunking of main(). It's enough
to get the ball rolling. The tooling I've written for
myself is sparse, but is getting better. A little more
work is needed. Code snippets are not visible in the
graph, and neither are logs turned into nodes.

@14:09 inner loop next thing to dig into #dz:codestudy/oed/files/main.c/main/10_loop
This is the meat of the program after the initial setup,
and where most of the program logic seems to be.

@14:32 Adding an ad-hoc file importer #dz:codestudy/oed/news
Hoping this will eventually grow into a re-usable tool.
My current version is written in my own special build of
Lua, which can be kind of clunky.
---
The program in question needs to take in a file and
import each line into a row called =dz_textfiles=. A
new filename should also be given, as it will appear
in the graph.
---
Once the data is in the database, the generator can
use this to produce code snippets in the metadata.

@15:33 and it's done! code can be viewed in dzbrowse. very nice.
