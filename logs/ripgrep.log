@22:28 Attempting to refamiliarize myself with this.

@21:24 got all the high-level functions
#! dz codestudy/ripgrep/files/crates/core/main.rs
Just the bare minimum, named nodes with file ranges.

@21:40 connecting nodes to run function
#! dz $/run
#! dz $

@21:50 diving into single-threaded search
#! dz $/search
This seems like a decent starting point

@21:50 where does anyhow come from? #nn:codestudy/ripgrep/questions/anyhow
#! dz $
It seems to be used everywhere in main.rs

@22:03 Interesting how lets are grouped by mutable immutable
#! dz $/search
also, they are at the top
