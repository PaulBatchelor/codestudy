After thinking about this for a while, I'm finally jumping
in. I am doing a dive on the SQLite API. Specifically,
I am studying the C example found in the docs for using
the C API. My goal is to trace these top-level functions
as deep as I can, mapping the source code and linking it
to high-level documentation and reference material found
on the website. We shall see how far I get.
