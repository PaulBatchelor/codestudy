After thinking about this for a while, I'm finally jumping
in. I am doing a dive on the SQLite API. Specifically,
I am studying the C example found in the docs for using
the C API. My goal is to trace these top-level functions
as deep as I can, mapping the source code and linking it
to high-level documentation and reference material found
on the website. We shall see how far I get.

@11:09 beginning to look into openDatabse today

@11:08 glossing over this part
#! dz $/some_variable_initialization 
I'm glossing over this part. But it seems like generally
things are being set in the newly allocated SQLite database

@11:08 look at all this!
#! dz $/set_flags

@11:19 I've just stumbled on a very intimidating numbers
#! dz $/EVIDENCE_OF_R_52786_44878
#! dz $/add_default_collation_sequence_binary
There's a very peculiar number I found: R-52786-44878,
a shorthand for a much larger number.
Looking this up, it corresponds to a set of standards
in the SQLite file spec. It seems I stumbled upon another
layer of documentation I'll have to take a look at at
some point.

Where do these numbers come from?
---
Also noteworthy: "EVIDENCE-OF" seems to be a special keyword
in the comments, most likely used for documentation
generation. Probably worth looking into at some point.

@11:40 doesn't seem to be a part of default documentation bundle
#! dz codestudy/sqlite/references/R_52786_44878
I just dowloaded the 3.48 docs and tried grepping for
52786. The number does not appear
