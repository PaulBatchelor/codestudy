Still figuring out how to manage this codestudy infra

@11:01 Added editorial solution

@11:12 Negative one return value makes me think a bit

I think looking at the return statement makes things clearer
maybe? This code is always adding 1 to the max result.
A height of zero will happen if there are no child nodes.
If there is one child node the height will be at least 1,
as the result will always be positive (zero inclusive).
