@13:53 Getting things set up

My main goal is to just get comfortable looking at
more web code using something react-y

@14:06 initial scaffolding of app.vue
#! dz codestudy/teatime/files/app.vue

@14:11 It's IPFS, how does one implement an IPFS?

@14:11 My first time looking at a vue code
#! dz codestudy/teatime/questions/app_structure_vue
#! dz codestudy/teatime/files/app.vue
I'm not exactly sure how to tackle this. I'm assuming
the entry point is app.vue. It looks like they use
a routing system similar to NextJS (this is Nuxt, so
maybe that's Vue trying to be NextJS? Not sure where
the Vue stops and the NextJS starts).
